"""Frozen, read-only plan for moving session branches between two machines.

The plan is the whole decision: which sessions may fast-forward, which are in
conflict, and which are blocked and why. Building it writes nothing. Applying it
is a cold mutation that must quote the exact plan id, exactly like
``repair-projects apply``.

Two gates keep this honest:

* ``PROVEN_LAYOUTS`` is empty, so nothing may be written into a directory a
  Codex runtime reads. Where a transferred branch has to land inside
  ``sessions/`` is a property of that runtime, not of the source filename, and
  the source layout is metadata rather than an instruction.

  The gate covers exactly that destination and no more. The cloud mirror is
  codexSync's own copy — no Codex reads it — so its layout is not a guess about
  a runtime, and a branch written towards the mirror keeps the relative path it
  has in the state directory it came from (``MIRROR_LAYOUT_ID``). Gating the
  mirror too would leave the mirror with no way to be rebuilt at all, because
  sessions are excluded from generic mtime copying as semantic-owned.
* A write into the Codex state directory is refused unless the runtime's own
  thread catalogue already places that branch at exactly that path. On an
  observed machine every session on disk has a catalogue row naming its rollout
  file, so the file system is not the whole truth about where a session lives:
  a branch put somewhere the catalogue does not name is invisible, with no
  error. Making the runtime see a *new* session would mean writing that
  database, which codexSync only ever reads — so it is
  ``UNSUPPORTED_STATE_BACKEND``, not a half-transfer. Overwriting a branch the
  catalogue already points at is exactly the case that stays allowed.

Conflicts are never resolved here. A divergence produces a conflict id and the
plan blocks until a versioned resolution is recorded, so the branch that loses
is still on disk, byte for byte.
