"""A read-only view of which chats exist and which project each one is in.

This is the picture a person needs before moving anything: the projects, the
chats under them, and the chats under none. It answers three questions the raw
state does not answer on its own.

**Which sessions are chats.** Roughly half of the session files on a real
machine are sub-threads an agent spawned, not conversations anybody started.
They are told apart structurally, by the ``parent_thread_id`` and
``thread_source`` the runtime itself writes — never by looking at what the
records say. A text heuristic would silently reclassify a chat the day someone
writes the wrong sentence in it.

**Which project a chat belongs to.** Measured on real state, both mechanisms
are live: a chat with a ``thread-project-assignments`` entry is bound to that
project, and a chat without one reaches a project only by its ``cwd`` falling
under the project's root. So the association is reported *with its reason*
(:class:`Association`), because the two behave differently the moment a project
moves: a bound chat follows the project, a derived one is left behind by the
old path. That distinction is the whole reason this module exists.

There is a third reason, and it is the one a person hits after moving between
machines. A chat written on the desktop records a ``D:`` path; on the laptop the
same project lives under ``C:``, so the chat derives to nothing and Codex shows
it under no project at all. Given ``[[path_mappings]]`` this module can still
say which project it *means* — reported as ``DERIVED_VIA_MAPPING`` and never
folded into a plain ``DERIVED``, because the runtime does not know those rules.
A chat in that state is invisible in Codex until it is given a real binding,
which makes this exactly the list of chats a handoff leaves to repair.

**What a chat is about.** The title is the first thing the person actually
typed — an ``event_msg`` record of type ``user_message``. Everything the
runtime injects into the conversation as if the user had said it (an
environment block, a plugin list, a desktop-context preamble) is not that, and
is skipped.

Nothing here writes, and nothing here decides: a caller that wants to change an
association builds a plan from this view and applies it through the ordinary
mutation envelope.
